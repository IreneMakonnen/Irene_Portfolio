**Recommendations:**

* *Access Control Policies, Least Privilege, and Separation of Duties:*  
  Enhance security by updating Access Control Policies to ensure that employees are granted only the Least Privilege necessary to perform their roles, minimizing unnecessary access to sensitive customer data. Implement Separation of Duties for key functions, like payroll and financial management, to reduce the risk of insider fraud. These measures align with the System and Organizations Controls (SOC type 1, SOC type 2\) and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) by safeguarding customer payment data, ensuring only authorized personnel can access it, and mitigating the risk of compromised accounts.  
* *Disaster recovery plans*:   
  Set up recovery plans to ensure data is quickly restored and secure in case of a data breach.  
* *Encryption, Password Policies, Password Management Systems, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), and Backups:*  
  Strengthen security by enforcing strong password policies and implementing Password Management Systems to lower the risk of credential compromise. Use Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to monitor and prevent unauthorized access to systems, while regular Backups ensure critical data can be restored in the event of a breach. Implement Encryption to protect sensitive data, especially personal and financial information, ensuring compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which mandates strict controls over the confidentiality and integrity of data for European Union customers.  
* *Manual Monitoring, Maintenance, and Intervention for Legacy Systems:*  
  Regularly monitor and maintain legacy systems to identify and address vulnerabilities before they are exploited. This proactive approach ensures that outdated systems do not compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data, which can lead to security breaches and non-compliance.
