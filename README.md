### Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate

I successfully completed an 8-course Google Cybersecurity Certificate program, where I gained hands-on experience with essential tools and techniques.

Throughout my studies, I developed technical skills such as `Python`, `Linux`, `SQL`, `Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools`, `Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)`, as well as key soft skills like `Communication`, `Collaboration`, `Analysis` and `Problem-solving`.

Below you'll find an overview of the projects I worked on, detailing the skills acquired, the methodologies applied, and the technologies used in simulated cybersecurity scenarios.
