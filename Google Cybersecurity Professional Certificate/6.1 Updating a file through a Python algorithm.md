# Updating a file through a Python algorithm

## Scenario

You are a security professional working at a health care company. As part of your job, you're required to regularly update a file that identifies the employees who can access restricted content. The contents of the file are based on who is working with personal patient records. Employees are restricted access based on their IP address. There is an allow list for IP addresses permitted to sign into the restricted subnetwork. There's also a remove list that identifies which employees you must remove from this allow list.

Your task is to create an algorithm that uses Python code to check whether the allow list contains any IP addresses identified on the remove list. If so, you should remove those IP addresses from the file containing the allow list.

## Algorithm for file updates in Python

As a security analyst at a health care company, itâ€™s required to regularly update a file, "allow_list.txt", that identifies the employees who can access restricted content. The file contents are based on who is working with personal patient records and employees are restricted access based on their IP address. 

### Open file containing allow list

As shown in the code block below, I assigned the file name containing the allow list as a string to the variable `import_file`.
I also assigned a variable to the list of IP addresses that need to be revoked access.
I used a `with` statement and the `open()` function to open the "allow_list.txt" file and read, `"r"`, its contents. The purpose of opening the file is to allow me to access the IP addresses stored in the allow list file. The `with` keyword will help manage the resources by closing the file after exiting the `with` statement. The output of the `open()` function is stored in a variable `file` while I work with it inside the `with` statement.

```Python
# Assign `import_file` to the name of the file 

import_file = "allow_list.txt"

# Assign `remove_list` to a list of IP addresses that are no longer allowed to access restricted information. 

remove_list = ["192.168.97.225", "192.168.158.170", "192.168.201.40", "192.168.58.57"]

# First line of `with` statement

with open(import_file, "r") as file:

$ File "<ipython-input-2-b925af1022fc>", line 11
    with open(import_file, "r") as file:
                                        ^
SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing
```

### Read file contents

As shown in the code block below, after opening the file, I used the `.read()` method with the `file` variable in the `with` statement to convert the contents of the "allow_list.txt" file to a string so as to read it. I stored the string contents into a variable, `ip_addresses`.

In summary, this code reads the contents of the "allow_list.txt" file into a string format that allows me to later use the string to organize and extract data in my Python program.

```
# Assign `import_file` to the name of the file 

import_file = "allow_list.txt"

# Assign `remove_list` to a list of IP addresses that are no longer allowed to access restricted information. 

remove_list = ["192.168.97.225", "192.168.158.170", "192.168.201.40", "192.168.58.57"]

# Build `with` statement to read in the initial contents of the file

with open(import_file, "r") as file:

  # Use `.read()` to read the imported file and store it in a variable named `ip_addresses`

  ip_addresses = file.read()

# Display `ip_addresses`

print(ip_addresses)

$ ip_address
192.168.25.60
192.168.205.12
192.168.97.225
192.168.6.9
192.168.52.90
192.168.158.170
192.168.90.124
192.168.186.176
192.168.133.188
192.168.203.198
192.168.201.40
192.168.218.219
192.168.52.37
192.168.156.224
192.168.60.153
192.168.58.57
192.168.69.116
```

### Convert string into a list

As shown in the code block below, after reading the file contents, I used the `.split()` method to convert the string stored in the `ip_addresses` variable to a list format so that I can be able to remove individual IP addresses from the allow list.

The `.split()` function is called by appending it to a string variable. It works by converting the contents of a string to a list. The purpose of splitting `ip_addresses` into a list is to make it easier to remove IP addresses from the allow list. By default, the `.split()` function splits the text by whitespace into list elements.

I reassigned the list back to the variable `ip_addresses`.

```Python
# Assign `import_file` to the name of the file 

import_file = "allow_list.txt"

# Assign `remove_list` to a list of IP addresses that are no longer allowed to access restricted information. 

remove_list = ["192.168.97.225", "192.168.158.170", "192.168.201.40", "192.168.58.57"]

# Build `with` statement to read in the initial contents of the file

with open(import_file, "r") as file:

  # Use `.read()` to read the imported file and store it in a variable named `ip_addresses`

  ip_addresses = file.read()

# Use `.split()` to convert `ip_addresses` from a string to a list

ip_addresses = ip_addresses.split()

# Display `ip_addresses`

print(ip_addresses)

$ ['ip_address', '192.168.25.60', '192.168.205.12', '192.168.97.225', '192.168.6.9', '192.168.52.90', '192.168.158.170', '192.168.90.124', '192.168.186.176', '192.168.133.188', '192.168.203.198', '192.168.201.40', '192.168.218.219', '192.168.52.37', '192.168.156.224', '192.168.60.153', '192.168.58.57', '192.168.69.116']
```

### Iterate through remove list

As shown in the code block below, after converting the string into a list with the `.split()` method,  I created a `for` loop to iterate through the list of IP addresses to be removed in the `remove_list` variable. 

The `for` loop in Python repeats code for a specified sequence. The overall purpose of the `for` loop in a Python algorithm like this is to apply specific code statements to all elements in a sequence. The `for` keyword starts the `for` loop. 

I used `element` as the variable of the `for` loop. The keyword `in` indicates to iterate through the sequence `ip_addresses` and assign each value to the loop variable `element`.

```Python
# Assign `import_file` to the name of the file 

import_file = "allow_list.txt"

# Assign `remove_list` to a list of IP addresses that are no longer allowed to access restricted information. 

remove_list = ["192.168.97.225", "192.168.158.170", "192.168.201.40", "192.168.58.57"]

# Build `with` statement to read in the initial contents of the file

with open(import_file, "r") as file:

  # Use `.read()` to read the imported file and store it in a variable named `ip_addresses`

  ip_addresses = file.read()

# Use `.split()` to convert `ip_addresses` from a string to a list

ip_addresses = ip_addresses.split()

# Build iterative statement
# Name loop variable `element`
# Loop through `ip_addresses`

for element in ip_addresses:

    # Display `element` in every iteration

    print(element)

$ ip_address
192.168.25.60
192.168.205.12
192.168.97.225
192.168.6.9
192.168.52.90
192.168.158.170
192.168.90.124
192.168.186.176
192.168.133.188
192.168.203.198
192.168.201.40
192.168.218.219
192.168.52.37
192.168.156.224
192.168.60.153
192.168.58.57
192.168.69.116
```

### Remove IP addressess that are on the remove list

As shown in the code block below, after creating a `for` loop to iterate through the list of IP addresses, I created a conditional statement within the `for` loop that evaluates if the `element` variable is present in the `remove_list` list. 

Within the conditional statement, I applied the `.remove()` method with the `ip_addresses` variable to remove the IP address that matches the `element` variable.

```Python
# Assign `import_file` to the name of the file 

import_file = "allow_list.txt"

# Assign `remove_list` to a list of IP addresses that are no longer allowed to access restricted information. 

remove_list = ["192.168.97.225", "192.168.158.170", "192.168.201.40", "192.168.58.57"]

# Build `with` statement to read in the initial contents of the file

with open(import_file, "r") as file:

  # Use `.read()` to read the imported file and store it in a variable named `ip_addresses`

  ip_addresses = file.read()

# Use `.split()` to convert `ip_addresses` from a string to a list

ip_addresses = ip_addresses.split()

# Build iterative statement
# Name loop variable `element`
# Loop through `ip_addresses`

for element in ip_addresses:
  
  # Build conditional statement
  # If current element is in `remove_list`,
  
    if element in remove_list:

        # then current element should be removed from `ip_addresses`

        ip_addresses.remove(element)

# Display `ip_addresses` 

print(ip_addresses)

$ ['ip_address', '192.168.25.60', '192.168.205.12', '192.168.6.9', '192.168.52.90', '192.168.90.124', '192.168.186.176', '192.168.133.188', '192.168.203.198', '192.168.218.219', '192.168.52.37', '192.168.156.224', '192.168.60.153', '192.168.69.116']
```

### Update file with revised list of IP addresses

As shown in the code block below, after removing the IP addresses, the allow list file needed to be updated. To do this, the file was converted back into a string using the `.join()` method and a `" "` (spacebar) as the separator in the string to place each ip address after a space.

The `.join()` method combines all items in an iterable into a string. It is applied to a string containing characters that will separate the elements in the iterable once joined into a string.

I reassigned the updated list back to the variable `ip_addresses` so that it can be written into the text file when I pass it as an argument in the `.write()` method.

I then used another `with` statement to open and rewrite to the `import_file` file that contained the previous list of allowed IP addresses. Within the `with` statement, I used the `.write()` method with the file object `file` to write over the file and update it with the revised list of IP addresses. I passed in the `ip_addresses` variable as the argument to specify that the contents of the file specified in the `with` statement should be replaced with the data in this variable.

The `.write()` function writes string data to a specified file and replaces any existing file content.

The restricted content will no longer be accessible to any IP addresses that were removed from the allow list.

```Python
# Assign `import_file` to the name of the file 

import_file = "allow_list.txt"

# Assign `remove_list` to a list of IP addresses that are no longer allowed to access restricted information. 

remove_list = ["192.168.97.225", "192.168.158.170", "192.168.201.40", "192.168.58.57"]

# Build `with` statement to read in the initial contents of the file

with open(import_file, "r") as file:

  # Use `.read()` to read the imported file and store it in a variable named `ip_addresses`

  ip_addresses = file.read()

# Use `.split()` to convert `ip_addresses` from a string to a list

ip_addresses = ip_addresses.split()

# Build iterative statement
# Name loop variable `element`
# Loop through `ip_addresses`

for element in ip_addresses:
  
  # Build conditional statement
  # If current element is in `remove_list`,
  
    if element in remove_list:

        # then current element should be removed from `ip_addresses`

        ip_addresses.remove(element)

# Convert `ip_addresses` back to a string so that it can be written into the text file 

ip_addresses = " ".join(ip_addresses)    

# Build `with` statement to rewrite the original file

with open(import_file, "w") as file:

  # Rewrite the file, replacing its contents with `ip_addresses`

  file.write(ip_addresses)
```

## Summary

I created an algorithm that reads and updates a file "allow_list.txt" that contains IP addresses that are allowed to access restricted content and removes those that no longer have access. 

The algorithm uses the `open()` method to either read or write on the file, convert the file contents to a string with the `.read()` method so as to read the contents easily and then convert the string into a list with the `.split()` method. 

I created a `for` loop to iterate through each element to identify if an element was part of the `ip_addresses` list. If it wasnâ€™t, it is removed with the `.remove()` method. 

Afterwards, I used the `.join()` method to convert the `ip_addresses` list back to a string to revise IP addresses and opened the file to write over the "allow_list.txt" file with the `.write()` method.

IP addresses that were removed from the allow list will no longer have access to restricted content.
