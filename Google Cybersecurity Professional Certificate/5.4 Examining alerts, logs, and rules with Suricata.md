# Examining alerts, logs, and rules with Suricata

## Scenario
You’re a security analyst who must monitor traffic on your employer's network. You’ll be required to configure Suricata and use it to trigger alerts.

For the purposes of the tests run, a sample.pcap file and a custom.rules file have been supplied. These reside in the home folder.
- The `sample.pcap` file is a packet capture file that contains an example of network traffic data, which you’ll use to test the Suricata rules. This will allow you to simulate and repeat the exercise of monitoring network traffic.
- The `custom.rules` file contains a custom rule when the lab activity starts. You’ll add rules to this file and run them against the network traffic data in the `sample.pcap` file.
- The `fast.log` file will contain the alerts that Suricata generates. The `fast.log` file is empty when the lab starts. Each time you test a rule, or set of rules, against the sample network traffic data, Suricata adds a new alert line to the `fast.log` file when all the conditions in any of the rules are met. The `fast.log` file can be located in the `/var/log/suricata` directory after Suricata runs.The `fast.log` file is considered to be a depreciated format and is not recommended for incident response or threat hunting tasks but can be used to perform quick checks or tasks related to quality assurance.
- The `eve.json` file is the main, standard, and default log for events generated by Suricata. It contains detailed information about alerts triggered, as well as other network telemetry events, in JSON format. The `eve.json` file is generated when Suricate runs, and can also be located in the `/var/log/suricata` directory.

### Examining a custom rule in Suricata
The `custom.rules` file defines the network traffic rules, which Suricata captures.
The `cat` command to display the rule in the `custom.rules` file. The `less` command can also be used.

The command returns the rule as the output in the shell:
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9ff66e4-191c-4dba-a7c6-85c4a1ca9fd3)

This rule consists of three components: an **action**, a **header**, and **rule options**.

1. **Action** <br>
The **action** is the first part of the signature. It determines the action to take if all conditions are met. Actions differ across network intrusion detection system (NIDS) rule languages, but some common actions are `alert`, `drop`, `pass`, and `reject`.

   - As shown in the image above, the file contains a single `alert` as the action. The `alert` keyword instructs to alert on selected network traffic. The IDS will inspect the traffic packets and send out an alert in case it matches. <br>
   - The `drop` action also generates an alert, but it drops the traffic. A `drop` action only occurs when Suricata runs in IPS mode. <br>
   - The `pass` action allows the traffic to pass through the network interface. The pass rule can be used to override other rules. An exception to a drop rule can be made with a pass rule. <br>
   - The `reject` action does not allow the traffic to pass. Instead, a TCP reset packet will be sent, and Suricata will drop the matching packet. A TCP reset packet tells computers to stop sending messages to each other.

2. **Header** <br>
The next part of the signature is the **header**. The header defines the signature’s network traffic, which includes attributes such as protocols, source and destination IP addresses, source and destination ports, and traffic direction.

    The next field after the action keyword is the protocol field. In the image above, the protocol is `http`, which determines that the rule applies only to HTTP traffic.

    The parameters to the protocol `http` field are `$HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any`. The arrow indicates the direction of the traffic coming from the `$HOME_NET` and going to the destination IP address `$EXTERNAL_NET`.

    `$HOME_NET` is a Suricata variable defined in `/etc/suricata/suricata.yaml` that can be used in rule definitions as a placeholder for local or home network to identify traffic that connects to or from systems within your organization.

    Above, `$HOME_NET` is defined as the 172.21.224.0/20 subnet.

    The word `any` means that Suricata catches traffic from any port defined in the `$HOME_NET` network.

    This signature triggers an alert when it detects any http traffic leaving the home network and going to the external network.


3. **Rule options** <br>
The many available **rule options** allow you to customize signatures with additional parameters. Configuring rule options helps narrow down network traffic so you can find exactly what you’re looking for. In the example, rule options are typically enclosed in a pair of parentheses and separated by semicolons: `(msg:"GET on wire"; flow:established,to_server; content:"GET"; http_method; sid:12345; rev:3;)`.

- The `msg:` option provides the alert text. In this case, the alert will print out the text `“GET on wire”`, which specifies why the alert was triggered.
- The `flow:established,to_server` option determines that packets from the client to the server should be matched. (In this instance, a server is defined as the device responding to the initial SYN packet with a SYN-ACK packet.)
- The `content:"GET"` option tells Suricata to look for the word `GET` in the content of the `http.method` portion of the packet.
- The `sid:12345` (signature ID) option is a unique numerical value that identifies the rule.
- The `rev:3` option indicates the signature's revision which is used to identify the signature's version. Here, the revision version is 3.

This signature triggers an alert whenever Suricata observes the text `GET` as the HTTP method in an HTTP packet from the home network going to the external network.

### Triggering a custom rule in Suricata
Before running Suricata, there are no files in the `/var/log/suricata` directory as shown in the image below.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/719a0446-e960-4a83-963c-924fd93efe22)

Suricata is run using  the `custom.rules` and `sample.pcap` files with the command `sudo suricata -r sample.pcap -S custom.rules -k none`. 

This command starts the Suricata application and processes the `sample.pcap` file using the rules in the `custom.rules` file. As shown below, it returns an output stating how many packets were processed by Suricata.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/840b86b8-53fe-4eb6-b1f9-a9ba854477a1)

- The `-r sample.pcap` option specifies an input file to mimic network traffic. In this case, the `sample.pcap` file.
- The `-S custom.rules` option instructs Suricata to use the rules defined in the `custom.rules` file.
- The `-k none` option instructs Suricata to disable all checksum checks.

Suricata adds a new alert line to the `/var/log/suricata/fast.log` file when all the conditions in any of the rules are met.

After running Suricata, the files listed show that there are now four files in the `/var/log/suricata` directory, including the `fast.log` and `eve.json` files.

When the `cat` command is used to display the `fast.log` file generated by Suricata, the output returns alert entries in the log.

Each line or entry in the `fast.log` file corresponds to an alert generated by Suricata when it processes a packet that meets the conditions of an alert generating rule. Each alert line includes the message that identifies the rule that triggered the alert, as well as the source, destination, and direction of the traffic.

### Examining eve.json output
The `eve.json` file is the standard and main Suricata log file and contains a lot more data than the `fast.log` file. This data is stored in a JSON format, which makes it much more useful for analysis and processing by other applications.

Using the `cat` command to display the entries in the `eve.json` file, the output returns the raw content of the file.

In the image above, there is a lot of data returned that is not easy to understand in this format.

Instead, the `jq` command can be used to display the entries in an improved format as shown below.

The `jq` command can also be used to extract specific event data from the `eve.json` file

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d485348e-fdce-44e9-8f5c-2075ab4591cc)

The jq command above extracts the fields specified in the list in the square brackets from the JSON payload. The fields selected are the timestamp (.timestamp), the flow id (.flow_id), the alert signature or msg (.alert.signature), the protocol (.proto), and the destination IP address (.dest_ip).

Also, the `jq` command can be used to display all event logs related to a specific `flow_id` from the `eve.json` file. The `flow_id` value is a 16-digit number and will vary for each of the log entries. 

The `flow_id` used below is `2102745463166196`.

A network flow refers to a sequence of packets between a source and destination that share common characteristics such as IP addresses, protocols, and more. In cybersecurity, network traffic flows help analysts understand the behavior of network traffic to identify and analyze threats. Suricata assigns a unique flow_id to each network flow. All logs from a network flow share the same flow_id. This makes the flow_id field a useful field for correlating network traffic that belongs to the same network flows.
