# Capturing a packet with tcpdump

## Scenario
You’re a network analyst who needs to use `tcpdump` to capture and analyze live network traffic from a Linux virtual machine.

### Identifying network interfaces
It's important to identify the network interfaces that can be used to capture network packet data.
The use of `ifconfig` identifies the interfaces that are available. This is displayed in the image below.

The Ethernet network interface is identified by the entry with the `eth` prefix. The `eth0` will be used as the interface that will capture network packet data. 

As shown below, another command that will also allow you to identify which network interfaces are available is `sudo tcpdump -D` command. This may be useful on systems that do not include the ifconfig command.

### Inspecting the network traffic of a network interface with tcpdump
The command `sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -v -c5` filters live network packet data from the `eth0` interface with `tcpdump`.
This command will run `tcpdump` with the following options:
- `-i eth0`: Capture data specifically from the eth0 interface.
- `-v`: Display detailed packet data.
- `-c5`: Capture 5 packets of data.

The image below is an example of the output of this command.

#### Exploring network packet details
In the example (image) above, there are some properties that `tcpdump` outputs for the packet capture data.

1. In the example data at the start of the packet output, `tcpdump` reported that it was listening on the `eth0` interface, and it provided information on the link type and the capture size in bytes:

    `tcpdump: listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes`

2. On the next line, the first field is the packet's timestamp, followed by the protocol type, IP:
    
    `12:17:30.300460 IP`

3. The verbose option, `-v`, has provided more details about the IP packet fields, such as TOS, TTL, offset, flags, internal protocol type (in this case, TCP (6)), and the length of the outer IP packet in bytes. These are properties that relate to the IP network packet.:


    `(tos 0x0, ttl 64, id 55628, offset 0, flags [DF], proto TCP (6), length 113)`

4. In the next section, the data shows the systems that are communicating with each other:
    
    `bada242aa859.5000 > nginx-us-west1-c.c.qwiklabs-terminal-vms-prod-00.internal.46822:`

    By default, `tcpdump` will convert IP addresses into names, as in the screenshot. The name of the Linux virtual machine, also included in the command prompt, appears here as the source for one packet and the destination for the second packet. In your live data, the name will be a different set of letters and numbers. <br>
    The direction of the arrow (>) indicates the direction of the traffic flow in this packet. Each system name includes a suffix with the port number (.5000 in the screenshot), which is used by the source and the destination systems for this packet.

5. The remaining data filters the header data for the inner TCP packet:

    `Flags [P.], cksum 0x588f (incorrect -> 0xffeb), seq 3897233388:3897233449, ack 1210809476, win 492, options [nop,nop,TS val 2989044232 ecr 3306375156], length 61`

    The flags field identifies TCP flags. In this case, the P represents the push flag and the period indicates it's an ACK flag. This means the packet is pushing out data. <br>
    The next field is the TCP checksum value, which is used for detecting errors in the data. <br>

    This section also includes the sequence and acknowledgment numbers, the window size, and the length of the inner TCP packet in bytes.

### Capturing network traffic with tcpdump
`tcpdump` is used to save the captured network data to a packet capture file.
Below, a filter and other `tcpdump` configuration options is used to save a small sample that contains only web (TCP port 80) network packet data.
To capture packet data into a file called `capture.pcap`, the following command is used: `sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -nn -c9 port 80 -w capture.pcap &`

This command will run `tcpdump` in the background with the following options:

- `-i eth0`: Capture data from the `eth0` interface.
- `-nn`: Do not attempt to resolve IP addresses or ports to names.This is best practice from a security perspective, as the lookup data may not be valid. It also prevents malicious actors from being alerted to an investigation.
- `-c9`: Capture 9 packets of data and then exit.
- `port 80`: Filter only port 80 traffic. This is the default HTTP port.
- `-w capture.pcap`: Save the captured data to the named file.
- `&`: This is an instruction to the Bash shell to run the command in the background.
This command runs in the background, but some output text will appear in your terminal.

The `curl` command is used to generate some HTTP (port 80) traffic:

When the `curl` command is used like this (`curl opensource.google.com`) to open a website, it generates some HTTP (TCP port 80) traffic that can be captured. <br>
To verify that the packet data has been captured, the command `ls -l capture.pcap` is used.

The "Done" in the output indicates that the packet was captured.

### Filtering the captured packet data
`tcpdump` can be used to filter data from a packet capture file.<br>
The command `sudo tcpdump -nn -r capture.pcap -v` filters the packet header data from the `capture.pcap` capture file.
This command will run `tcpdump` with the following options:

- `-nn`: Disable port and protocol name lookup since this can alert threat actors.
- `-r`: Read capture data from the named file.
- `-v`: Display detailed packet data.

The ouptut data returns the IP packet information along with information about the data that the packet contains:

The `tcpdump` command can filter the extended packet data from a capture file. <br>
The command `sudo tcpdump -nn -r capture.pcap -X` will run `tcpdump` with the following options:

- `-nn`: Disable port and protocol name lookup.
- `-r`: Read capture data from the named file.
- `-X`: Display the hexadecimal and ASCII output format packet data. Security analysts can analyze hexadecimal and ASCII output to detect patterns or anomalies during malware analysis or forensic analysis.

The output returned is:
