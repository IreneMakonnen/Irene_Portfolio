# Scenario
You are a security analyst working for a social media organization. The organization recently experienced a major data breach, which compromised the safety of their customers’ personal information, such as names and addresses. Your organization wants to implement strong network hardening practices that can be performed consistently to prevent attacks and breaches in the future. 

After inspecting the organization’s network, you discover four major vulnerabilities. The four vulnerabilities are as follows:

1. The organization’s employees' share passwords.

2. The admin password for the database is set to the default.

3. The firewalls do not have rules in place to filter traffic coming in and out of the network.

4. Multifactor authentication (MFA) is not used. 

If no action is taken to address these vulnerabilities, the organization is at risk of experiencing another data breach or other attacks in the future. 

## Security Risk Assessment Report 
### Part 1: Select up to three hardening tools and methods to implement
1. Password policies - Introduce guidelines for changing default passwords immediately and ensuring that passwords are kept confidential and not shared.
2. Firewall maintenance - Update security configurations by setting up firewall rules to prevent unusual or suspicious network traffic.
3. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) - Implement user verification by requiring two or more authentication methods, such as biometrics or a one-time password (OTP), to confirm identity.

### Part 2: Explain your recommendations
1. Enforcing password policies helps ensure that attackers cannot easily gain access. Each user should have unique access to their password to prevent leaks or easy guesses. Changing default passwords immediately strengthens security. Password policies can be implemented once and periodically reviewed.
2. Configuring firewall rules helps identify and block potential threats. This should be implemented once and maintained regularly to stay ahead of evolving threats. 
3. Multi-factor authentication verifies a user’s identity before granting access, adding an extra layer of security. This can be set up initially and maintained with regular checks to ensure effectiveness.
