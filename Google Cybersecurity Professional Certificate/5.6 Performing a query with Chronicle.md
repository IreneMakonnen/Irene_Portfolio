# Performing a query with Chronicle

## Scenario
You are a security analyst at a financial services company. You receive an alert that an employee received a phishing email in their inbox. You review the alert and identify a suspicious domain name contained in the email's body: `signin.office365x24.com`. You need to determine whether any other employees have received phishing emails containing this domain and whether they have visited the domain. You will use Chronicle to investigate this domain.

### Performing a domain search
In the search bar. `signin.office365x24.com` is input and searched.

### Evaluating the search results
After performing a domain search, you'll be in the domain view. In the search results, the following are displayed:
- **VT CONTEXT**: This section provides the VirusTotal information available for the domain. 

- **WHOIS**: This section provides a summary of information about the domain using WHOIS, a free and publicly available directory that includes information about registered domain names, such as the name and contact information of the domain owner. In cybersecurity, this information is helpful in assessing a domain's reputation and determining the origin of malicious websites. 

- **Prevalence**: This section provides a graph which outlines the historical prevalence of the domain. This can be helpful when you need to determine whether the domain has been accessed previously. Usually, less prevalent domains may indicate a greater threat.

- **RESOLVED IPS**: This insight card provides additional context about the domain, such as the IP address that maps to `signin.office365x24.com`, which is `40.100.174.34`. <br>
Clicking on this IP will run a new search for the IP address in Chronicle.

    Insight cards can be helpful in expanding the domain investigation and further investigating an indicator to determine whether there is a broader compromise.

- **SIBLING DOMAINS**: This insight card provides additional context about the domain. Sibling domains share a common top or parent domain. For example, here the sibling domain is listed as `login.office365x24.com`, which shares the same top domain `office365x24.com` with the domain you're investigating: `signin.office365x24.com`.

- **TIMELINE**: This tab provides information about the events and interactions made with this domain.

    When **EXPAND ALL** is clicked, it reveals the details about the HTTP requests made including GET and POST requests.  A GET request retrieves data from a server while a POST request submits data to a server.

One can observe the vendors who have flagged the domain as malicious.

### Investigating the affected assets and events
Information about the events and assets relating to the domain are separated into the two tabs: **TIMELINE** and **ASSETS**. **TIMELINE** shows the timeline of events that includes when each asset accessed the domain. **ASSETS** list hostnames, IP addresses, MAC addresses, or devices that have accessed the domain.

- **ASSETS**: There are 6 different assets that have accessed the domain. All first accessed the domain on Jan 31, 2023 and last accessed on July 9, 2023.

- **TIMELINE**: The POST information is especially useful because it means that data was sent to the domain. It also suggests a possible successful phish. The POST requests to the `/login.php` page were 6. This indicates that sensitive information was submitted to the login page such as login credentials. The raw log viewer gives more details about the connections.

### Investigating resolved IP addresses
Attackers sometimes reuse infrastructure for multiple attacks. In these cases, multiple domain names resolve to the same IP address.

The IP address found under the **RESOLVED IPS** insight card is investigated to identify if the `signin.office365x24.com` domain uses another domain.
The search for the IP address `40.100.174.34` reveals:
- **TIMELINE**: The additional POST requests are 3. A new `POST` suggests that an asset may have been phished.
