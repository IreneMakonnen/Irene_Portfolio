# Using Linux commands to manage file permissions
## Scenario
You are a security professional at a large organization. You mainly work with their research team. Part of your job is to ensure users on this team are authorized with the appropriate permissions. This helps keep the system secure. 

Your task is to examine existing permissions on the file system. You’ll need to determine if the permissions match the authorization that should be given. If they do not match, you’ll need to modify the permissions to authorize the appropriate users and remove any unauthorized access.

## File permissions in Linux

### Project description
The research team at the organization need to update file permissions for specific files and directories in the projects  folder, as the current settings do not match the appropriate authorization levels. Reviewing and adjusting these permissions will strengthen system security. To accomplish this, I performed the following steps.

### Check file and directory details
To check permission for files and directories the command used is the ls -l. To include hidden files, the ls -la command is used instead.

As the screenshot above shows, in the /home/researcher2/projects directory, there is one subdirectory and five files with the following names and permissions: 
The subdirectory is named drafts. The permissions on drafts are shown as drwx—-x—--.
This reveals that:
- The user has all privileges to read, write and execute.
- The group has only execute privileges.
- Others have no privileges.

1. The file project_k.txt shows -rw-rw-rw-
This reveals that:
    - The user, group and others have read and write privileges only.

2. The file project_m.txt shows -rw-r—----
This reveals that:
    - The user has read and write privileges only.
    - The group has only read privileges.
    - Others have no access privileges.

3. The file project_r.txt shows -rw-rw-r--
This reveals that:
    - The user and group have read and write privileges only.
    - Others have read privileges only.

4. The file project_t.txt shows -rw-rw-r--
This reveals that:
    - The user and group have read and write privileges only.
    - Others have read only privileges.

5. The hidden file .project_x.txt as shown above has -rw--w—---
This reveals that:
    - The user has read and write privileges only.
    - The group has write privileges only.
    - Others have no access privileges.

### Describe the permissions string
The 10-character permissions string indicates who has authorization to access the file and what specific permissions are granted to them. For example:

![Describe the permissions string](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64bc6a4d-934a-4552-9ae1-642166701163)

For the subdirectory drafts, the permissions are shown as drwx—-x—--. 
Here: 
- The 1st character d indicates that its a directory
- The 2nd-4th characters rwx indicate that the directory owner has the privilege to read, write and access the files in the subdirectory.
- The 5th-7th characters  —-x indicate that the users have access to only create new files in the subdirectory.
- The final 8th-10th characters —--, indicate that others have no access privilege to the directory.

For the file project_m.txt, the permissions are shown as -rw-r-——--. 
Here:
- The 1st character - indicates that its a file
- The 2nd-4th characters rw- indicate that the user has read and write privileges only.
- The 5th-7th characters r-- indicate that the group has read only privileges.
- The final 8th-10th characters —-- indicate that others have no access privileges to the file.

### Change file permissions
Since the organization does not allow others to have write access to any files, the command to remove write details is chmod o-w filename.

![Change file permissions 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5d86a02-798e-4375-9066-3984a063e380)

For example, as shown above, the file project_k.txt initially has write permissions for others.
After entering the command chmod o-w project_k.txt, the write permission for others is removed.

### Change file permissions on a hidden file
The hidden file .project_x.txt should not have write permissions for anyone, but the user and group should have read access. The command to remove write access is chmod u-w,g=r .project_x.txt.

![Change file permissions on a hidden file 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2691e99b-bee3-469e-81f1-71f37b2cf6dd)

After entering the command chmod u-w,g=r .project_x.txt, the write permissions for the user is removed and the read permissions for the group is added.

### Changing directory permissions
The files and directories in the projects directory belong to the researcher2 user. Only researcher2 should be allowed to access the drafts directory and its contents. 
As shown below, the group has execute privileges to the directory. 
The command to remove execute permission for the group is chmod g-x drafts.

### Summary
Managing directory and file permissions is essential to reduce security risks. I adjusted several permissions to align with the authorization levels required by the organization for files and directories within the projects  directory.
Using the ls -l  and ls -la options allowed me to investigate directory and file permissions. Using chmod allowed me to change user permissions ensuring that they are aligned with the principle of least privilege.
