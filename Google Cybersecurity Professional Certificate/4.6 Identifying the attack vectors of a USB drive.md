# Identifying the attack vectors of a USB drive

## Scenario
You are part of the security team at Rhetorical Hospital and arrive to work one morning. On the ground of the parking lot, you find a USB stick with the hospital's logo printed on it. Thereâ€™s no one else around who might have dropped it, so you decide to pick it up out of curiosity.

You bring the USB drive back to your office where the team has virtualization software installed on a workstation. You create a virtual environment and plug the USB drive into the workstation.

The contents of the device appear to belong to Jorge Bailey, the human resource manager at Rhetorical Hospital.
Jorge's drive contains a mix of personal and work-related files. For example, it contains folders that appear to store family and pet photos. There is also a new hire letter and an employee shift schedule.

### Contents
The USB drive contains files with personally identifiable information (PII) as well as sensitive work files, including personal data on employees and details about hospital operations. 
Storing work files alongside personal files is not advisable, as these should always be kept separate to enhance data security and maintain organizational boundaries. 

### Attacker mindset
Information obtained from the USB drive could be used to harm Jorge, other employees, or the hospital. 
For example, an attacker could exploit the employee shift schedule to target employees directly or misuse the new hire letter to deceive job applicants with fraudulent offers. 
Additionally, personal data on Jorge and his relatives could be used for phishing or identity theft. 
A malicious actor might have deliberately planted the USB drive to entice an employee to plug it into a computer, potentially infecting the system with malware or infiltrating the organization's network. 

### Risk analysis
Educating employees about proper handling of unknown USB drives can significantly reduce risks. 
- Employees should never insert an unknown USB drive into their computers; instead, they should report it to security personnel for proper evaluation. - Disabling AutoRun/AutoPlay features prevents malicious code from executing automatically when a removable device is connected. 
- Work-related and personal information should always be stored on separate USB drives to minimize exposure risks. 
- Secure USB drive contents with passwords and encryption to protect sensitive data, and ensure regular backups are maintained to safeguard against theft or loss.
