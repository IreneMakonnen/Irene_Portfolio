# Documenting incidents with an incident handler's journal

## Scenario 1

A small U.S. health care clinic specializing in delivering primary-care services experienced a security incident on a Tuesday morning, at approximately 9:00 a.m. Several employees reported that they were unable to use their computers to access files like medical records. Business operations shut down because employees were unable to access the files and software needed to do their job.

Additionally, employees also reported that a ransom note was displayed on their computers. The ransom note stated that all the company's files were encrypted by an organized group of unethical hackers who are known to target organizations in healthcare and transportation industries. In exchange for restoring access to the encrypted files, the ransom note demanded a large sum of money in exchange for the decryption key. 

The attackers were able to gain access into the company's network by using targeted phishing emails, which were sent to several employees of the company. The phishing emails contained a malicious attachment that installed malware on the employee's computer once it was downloaded.

Once the attackers gained access, they deployed their ransomware, which encrypted critical files. The company was unable to access critical patient data, causing major disruptions in their business operations. The company was forced to shut down their computer systems and contact several organizations to report the incident and receive technical assistance.

| The 5 W's  | Who: An organized group of unethical hackers known to target organizations in healthcare and transportation industries. <br><br> What: The company’s files were encrypted and a ransom of a large sum of money was demanded in exchange for the decryption key to restore access to the encrypted files. <br><br> Where: At a small U.S health care clinic specializing in delivering primary-care services. <br><br> When: Tuesday at approximately 9:00 a.m. <br><br> Why: The attackers gained access to the company's network through targeted phishing emails sent to several employees. These emails contained a malicious attachment that, when downloaded, installed malware on the employee's computer, encrypting critical files and restricting access to critical patient data. |
| Additional notes | Is there an alternative to paying the ransom? <br><br> One of the ways to prevent a recurrence of the incident is employee training on identifying phishing emails. |

## Scenario 2
You are a level one security operations center (SOC) analyst at a financial services company. You have received an alert about a suspicious file being downloaded on an employee's computer. 

You investigate this alert and discover that the employee received an email containing an attachment. The attachment was a password-protected spreadsheet file. The spreadsheet's password was provided in the email. The employee downloaded the file, then entered the password to open the file. When the employee opened the file, a malicious payload was then executed on their computer.

## Scenario 3
You are a level-one security operations center (SOC) analyst at a financial services company. Previously, you received a phishing alert about a suspicious file being downloaded on an employee's computer. After investigating the email attachment file's hash, the attachment has already been verified malicious. Now that you have this information, you must follow your organization's process to complete your investigation and resolve the alert.

Your organization's security policies and procedures describe how to respond to specific alerts, including what to do when you receive a phishing alert.

### Alert ticket
| Ticket ID | Alert Message | Severity | Details | Ticket status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A-2703 | SERVER-MAIL Phishing attempt possible download of malware | Medium | The user may have opened a malicious email and opened attachments or clicked links. | Escalated |

| Ticket comments |
| :--- |
| Received a phishing alert about a suspicious file being downloaded on an employee's computer. <br> Reviewed the sender details and determined inconsistencies between the email address and sender name as well as many grammatical errors in the email subject and body indicating a phishing attempt. Checked the reputation of the attachment through its hash value in VirusTotal and confirmed the file is malicious. The alert severity is reported as medium. With these findings, I chose to escalate this ticket to a level-two SOC analyst to take further action. |

## Scenario 4
You recently joined the security team as a level-one security operation center (SOC) analyst at a mid-sized retail company. Along with its physical store locations, your company also conducts operations in e-commerce, which account for 80% of its sales.

You are spending your first week of training becoming familiar with the company's security processes and procedures. Recently, the company experienced a major security incident involving a data breach of over one million users. Because this was a recent and major security incident, your team is working to prevent incidents like this from happening again. This breach happened before you began working at the company. You have been asked to review the final report.

To gain an understanding of the incident's life cycle, your goals for your review are as follows:

- Goal 1: Identify exactly what happened.

- Goal 2: Identify when it happened. 

- Goal 3: Identify the response actions that the company took.

- Goal 4: Identify future recommendations.

| Description | Reviewing a final report |
| Tool(s) used | None |
| The 5 W's  | Who: A malicious attacker <br><br> What: The organization was affected by a security incident involving data theft. An individual was able to gain unauthorized access to customer personal identifiable information (PII) and financial information. Approximately 50,000 customer records were affected. The financial impact of the incident is estimated to be $100,000 in direct costs and potential loss of revenue. <br><br> Where: The incident happened at a mid-sized retail company in the e-commerce web application. <br><br> When: The security incident happened on  December 28, 2022, at 7:20 p.m. PT. <br><br> Why: The root cause of the incident was identified as a vulnerability in the e-commerce web application. This vulnerability allowed the attacker to perform a forced browsing attack and access customer transaction data by modifying the order number included in the URL string of a purchase confirmation page. This vulnerability allowed the attacker to access customer purchase confirmation pages, exposing customer data, which the attacker then collected and exfiltrated. After confirming the web application vulnerability, the security team analyzed the web application access logs. The logs indicated that the attacker accessed the information of thousands of purchase confirmation pages. |
| Additional notes | The organization collaborated with the public relations department to disclose the data breach to its customers. Additionally, the organization offered free identity protection services to customers affected by the incident. After the security team reviewed the associated web server logs, the cause of the attack was very clear. There was a single log source showing an exceptionally high volume of sequentially listed customer orders. <br> To prevent future recurrences, we are taking the following actions: <br> - Perform routine vulnerability scans and penetration testing. <br> - Implement the following access control mechanisms: Implement allowlisting to allow access to a specified set of URLs and automatically block all requests outside of this URL range; ensure that only authenticated users are authorized access to content. |
