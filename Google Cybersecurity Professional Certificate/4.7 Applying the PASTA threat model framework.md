# Applying the PASTA threat model framework

## Scenario
You’re part of the growing security team at a company for sneaker enthusiasts and collectors. The business is preparing to launch a mobile app that makes it easy for their customers to buy and sell shoes. 

You are performing a threat model of the application using the PASTA framework. You will go through each of the seven stages of the framework to identify security requirements for the new sneaker company app.

## PASTA Worksheet
### Stage 1: Define business and security objectives
The application should seamlessly connect sellers and shoppers, allowing buyers to directly message sellers with questions.t should provide an easy-to-use interface for signing-up, logging in, and managing accounts. Users can create member profiles internally or by connecting external accounts.
Features such as seller ratings should encourage good service, while the sales process should be clear and efficient. Additionally, users should have multiple payment options to ensure a smooth checkout process.. 
Compliance with industry regulations, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), is essential to protect payment and transaction data.

### Stage 2: Define the technical scope
The technologies used by the application include:
- Application programming interface (API)
- Public key infrastructure (PKI)
- SHA-256
- SQL

APIs play a critical role in facilitating data exchange between customers, partners, and employees. They handle significant volumes of sensitive data and connect various users and systems, making them a priority for securing the application.

PKI ensures secure communication through encryption and digital certificates, protecting sensitive data during transmission. However, vulnerabilities such as improper certificate management or weak key generation could undermine its effectiveness.

SHA-256 is employed for hashing sensitive data like passwords, ensuring that even if data is intercepted, it cannot be easily compromised. However, that doesn’t make them invulnerable to other exploits.

SQL databases also require attention due to the prevalence of SQL injection attacks. A successful SQL injection can allow malicious actors to obtain sensitive information, modify database tables, or even gain administrative rights to the database.

### Stage 3: Decompose application

The sample data flow diagram shows how a typical search request passes through multiple layers.
Key controls in place include:
Password-protected user accounts
PKI encryption and SHA-256 for securing sensitive data such as credit card details and passwords
SQL databases configured with prepared statements to prevent injection attacks

### Stage 4: Threat analysis
Internal Threats: Employees may be susceptible to social engineering attacks, potentially exposing sensitive information, such as internal system authentication logs.

External Threats: Malicious actors may exploit vulnerabilities through SQL injection, phishing, or session hijacking attacks, given the app's reliance on cookies for communication between layers.

### Stage 5: Vulnerability analysis
Vulnerabilities that could be exploited include: 
- Broken access control 
- Broken API token
- Cryptographic failures
- SQL injection due to a lack of prepared statements.
- Session hijacking caused by improper handling of cookies between input and output sources.

### Stage 6: Attack modeling

This sample attack tree demonstrates how user data could be exposed to the previously identified attacks. 
For example:
- SQL injection exploits may occur if prepared statements are not used to validate inputs before executing queries.
- Session hijacking could result from weak login credentials or improper handling of cookies.

### Stage 7: Risk analysis and impact
To mitigate identified risks, the following security controls should be implemented:
Operational Controls: Employee training and awareness programs to address threats like phishing and social engineering.
Technical Controls: Escape user inputs to prevent SQL injection, enforce prepared statements, implement effective encryption methods and introduce hash functions such as SHA-256.
Managerial Controls: Enforce the principle of least privilege, establish a strong password policy and implement incident response procedures.
