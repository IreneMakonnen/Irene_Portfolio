# Determining appropriate data handling practices

## Scenario
You work for an educational technology company that developed an application to help teachers automatically grade assignments. The application handles a wide range of data that it collects from academic institutions, instructors, parents, and students.

Your team was alerted to a data leak of internal business plans on social media. An investigation by the team discovered that an employee accidentally shared those confidential documents with an external business partner. An audit into the leak is underway to determine how similar incidents can be avoided.

A supervisor provided you with information regarding the leak. It appears that the principle of least privilege was not observed by employees at the company during a sales meeting. You have been asked to analyze the situation and find ways to prevent it from happening again.

#### Incident summary 
A sales manager shared access to a folder of internal-only documents with their team during a meeting. The folder contained files associated with a new product that has not been publicly announced. It also included customer analytics and promotional materials. After the meeting, the manager did not revoke access to the internal folder, but warned the team to wait for approval before sharing the promotional materials with others.

During a video call with a business partner, a member of the sales team forgot the warning from their manager. The sales representative intended to share a link to the promotional materials so that the business partner could circulate the materials to their customers. However, the sales representative accidentally shared a link to the internal folder instead. Later, the business partner posted the link on their company's social media page assuming that it was the promotional materials.

| Control | Least privilege |
| :--- | :--- |
| Issue(s) | The factor that led to the information leak was that access to the folder was not restricted to the manager and sales team. Elevated access was granted to a team member who subsequently shared the same access with a business partner, who should not have been authorized to share the promotional information. |
| Review | [NIST SP 800-53: AC-6](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Projects/risk-management/800-53%20Downloads/800-53r5/SP_800-53_v5_1-derived-OSCAL.pdf#page=39&zoom=100,120,422) addresses the principle of least privilege. It provides guidelines on how organizations can protect their data and includes a wide range of control categories to enhance the effectiveness of least privilege. Users should be granted only the minimal access and authorization required to complete a task or function. This principle aims to prevent users from operating at privilege levels higher than what is necessary to accomplish business objectives. |
| Recommendation(s) | The principle of least privilege can be improved by restricting access to sensitive resources based on a user’s role, automatically revoking access to information after a set period of time, maintaining activity logs for provisioned user accounts, and regularly auditing user privileges.|
| Justification | These improvements will help prevent data leaks by ensuring that shared information is accessible only to authorized employees. Automating security tasks whenever possible is a good way to reduce the chances of human error and minimize unnecessary exposure. It’s important to maintain records of who accessed what information and when, to support accountability and traceability. Regular audits of who can access team files can further limit the exposure of sensitive information. |
