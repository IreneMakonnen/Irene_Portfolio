# Analyzing a vulnerable system for a small business

## Scenario 
You are a newly hired cybersecurity analyst for an e-commerce company. The company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, you recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability.

You are tasked with completing a vulnerability assessment of the situation to communicate the potential risks to decision makers at the company.

## Vulnerability Assessment Report

### System Description
The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

### Scope
The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 2024 to August 2024. [NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-30r1.pdf) is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.

### Purpose
The information system being assessed is a publicly accessible database server that stores all company information. It’s important for the server to be secured since it supports all business operations. If the server becomes unavailable, all company systems and processes will be disrupted, leading to financial losses, loss of customers and other significant issues.

### Risk Assessment
| Threat source | Threat event | Likelihood | Severity | Risk |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Employee | Accidentally or purposely alter or delete information that they don’t have authorization to access that might affect daily or sensitive operations. | 1 | 3 | 3 |
| Hacker | Conduct Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. | 3 | 3 | 9 |
| Power outages | Disrupt critical operations. | 1 | 3 | 3 |
| Competitor | Obtain sensitive information via exfiltration | 1 | 3 | 3 |

### Approach
The risks considered include the business's data storage and management practices. The likelihood of each threat occurring and its potential impact on day-to-day operations were assessed.
- Employees with privileged access might alter or delete critical information, either accidentally or intentionally, causing operational disruptions or significant losses.
- Hackers may exploit the publicly accessible database server to disrupt operations through malicious activities, such as Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.
- Since all company information is stored in a single database, a power outage could severely halt operations.
- Competitors with advanced technical abilities might exfiltrate sensitive company data.

### Remediation Strategy
To mitigate these risks, the following measures are recommended:
- Authentication, Authorization, and Auditing: Implement mechanisms such as strong passwords, role-based access controls, and multi-factor authentication to restrict access to authorized users.
- Defense-in-Depth: Deploy firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems to strengthen security.
- Encryption: Use Transport Layer Security (TLS) instead of SSL for encrypting data in motion.
- IP Allow-Listing: Restrict database access to specific corporate office IP addresses to prevent unauthorized internet users from connecting.
- Public Key Infrastructure (PKI): Encrypt sensitive information using PKI systems.
- Data Backups: Regularly backup all data and information to ensure recoverability in case of an incident.
