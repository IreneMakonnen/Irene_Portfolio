# Improving authentication, authorization, and accounting for a small business

## Scenario
You’re the first cybersecurity professional hired by a growing business.

Recently, a deposit was made from the business to an unknown bank account. The finance manager says they didn’t make a mistake. Fortunately, they were able to stop the payment. The owner has asked you to investigate what happened to prevent any future incidents.

#### Authorization / Authentication
Upon further review of the event log, I identified details about the incident that provided insight into the root cause and security gaps.

| :--- | :--- |
| Notes(s) | The incident occurred due to access through a former contractor’s account, which remained active. This unauthorized access happened on 10/03/2023, using a computer. |
| Issue(s) | The contractor had legal/admin privileges despite their role as a contractor, allowing them to access payroll systems. The account remained active in 2023, even though it should have been deactivated immediately after their contract ended in 2019. |
| Recommendation(s) | To prevent such incidents, the business should establish a policy to revoke access to data after a set period or immediately upon an employee or contractor leaving the company. Additionally, user accounts should be granted only the minimal access and authorization required to complete their tasks or functions. |
