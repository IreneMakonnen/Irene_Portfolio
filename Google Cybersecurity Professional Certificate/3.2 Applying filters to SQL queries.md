# Applying filters to SQL queries
## Scenario
You are a security professional at a large organization. Part of your job is to investigate security issues to help keep the system secure. You recently discovered some potential security issues that involve login attempts and employee machines.

### Project description

As a security professional at an organization, I recently discovered some potential security issues that involve login attempts and employee machines. I examined the organization’s data in their employees and login attempts tables. 
The following steps show how I used SQL filters to retrieve records from different datasets and investigate the potential security issues.

### Retrieve after hours failed login attempts
I recently discovered a potential security incident that occurred after business hours. To investigate this, I reviewed failed login attempts in the log_in_attempts table that occurred after 6PM.
The query I used is:
    SELECT * 
    FROM log_in_attempts
    WHERE login_time > ‘18:00’ AND success = FALSE; 

I selected all data from the log_in_attempts table. I used the WHERE clause with an AND operator to filter my results to output only login attempts that occurred after 18:00 and were unsuccessful. The time of the login attempt is found in the login_time column. The first condition, login_time > '18:00', filters the login attempts that occurred after 18:00. The second condition, success = FALSE, filters for the failed login attempts. The success column contains a value of 0 when a login attempt fails. One can use either a value of 0 or FALSE to identify failed login attempts.

### Retrieve login attempts on specific dates
A suspicious event occurred on 2022-05-09. To investigate this event, I reviewed all login attempts which occurred on that day and on the day before.
The query I used is:
    SELECT *
    FROM log_in_attempts
    WHERE login_date > ‘2022-05-09’ OR login_date = ‘2022-05-08’; 

I selected all data from the log_in_attempts table. I used the WHERE clause with an OR operator to filter the results to output only login attempts that occurred on either 2022-05-09 or 2022-05-08. The date of the login attempt is found in the login_date column. The first condition, login_date = '2022-05-09', filters for logins on 2022-05-09. The second condition, login_date = '2022-05-08', filters for logins on 2022-05-08.

### Retrieve login attempts outside of Mexico
There’s been suspicious activity with login attempts, but the team determined that this activity didn't originate in Mexico. I investigated login attempts that occurred outside of Mexico. 
The query I used is:
    SELECT *
    FROM log_in_attempts
    WHERE NOT country LIKE ‘MEX%’; 

After selecting all data from the log_in_attempts table, I used a WHERE clause with NOT to filter for countries other than Mexico. When referring to Mexico, the country column contains values of both MEX and MEXICO. I used the LIKE keyword with MEX% to make sure my query reflects this.

### Retrieve employees in Marketing

With the team wanting to perform security updates on specific employee machines in the Marketing department, I was responsible for getting information on these employee machines. I used SQL filters to create a query that identifies all employees in the Marketing department for all offices in the East building.
The query that I used to view all employees is:
    SELECT *
    FROM employees
The query that I used for the specific Marketing department in the East building is:
    SELECT *
    FROM employees
    WHERE department = ‘Marketing’ OR office LIKE ‘East%’; 

I started by selecting all data from the employees table. Then, I used the WHERE clause with AND to filter for employees who work in the Marketing department and in the East building. The department of the employee is found in the department column, which contains values that include Marketing. The office is found in the office column. Some examples of values in this column are East-170, East-320, and North-434. I used the LIKE keyword with East% to filter for the East building with the specific office number.

### Retrieve employees in Finance or Sales

With the team needing to perform a different security update on machines for employees in the Sales and Finance departments, I used filters in SQL to create a query that identifies all employees in the Sales or Finance departments.
The query that I used is:
    SELECT *
    FROM employees
    WHERE department = ‘Finance’ OR department ‘Sales’; 

I selected all data from the employees table. I used a WHERE clause with OR to filter for employees who are in either the Finance or Sales departments. The department of the employee is found in the department column, which contains values that include Sales and Finance.

### Retrieve all employees not in IT
The team needs to make one more update to employee machines. The employees in the Information Technology department already had this update, but employees in all other departments need it. Using filters in SQL, I created a query that identifies all employees not in the IT department. 
The query that I used is:
    SELECT *
    FROM employees
    WHERE NOT department = ‘Information Technology’; 

I selected all data from the employees table. I used a WHERE clause with NOT to filter for employees not in this department. The department of the employee is found in the department column, which contains values that include Information Technology.

### Summary
I applied SQL filters to investigate potential security issues and update employee computers. Using two datasets (log_in_attempts  and employees), I identified failed login attempts after hours, reviewed login activity on specific dates, and analyzed activity outside of Mexico. Additionally, I retrieved targeted employee information for security updates in departments like Marketing, Finance, and Sales, while excluding IT employees. By leveraging WHERE clauses, operators like AND, OR, NOT, and the LIKE keyword, I effectively filtered data to address security needs.
