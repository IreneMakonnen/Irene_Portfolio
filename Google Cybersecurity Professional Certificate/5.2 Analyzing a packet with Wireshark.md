# Analyzing a packet with Wireshark

## Scenario 

I'm a security analyst investigating traffic to a website. I’ll analyze a network packet capture file that contains traffic data related to a user connecting to an internet site. 
I must filter the data in order to:
    - identify the source and destination IP addresses involved in this web browsing session
    - examine the protocols that are used when the user makes the connection to the website
    - analyze some of the data packets to identify the type of information sent and received by the systems that connect to each other when the network data is captured.

### Exploring data with Wireshark
Below is an overview of the key property columns listed for each packet:

- **No.** : The index number of the packet in this packet capture file
- **Time**: The timestamp of the packet
- **Source**: The source IP address
- **Destination**: The destination IP address
- **Protocol**: The protocol contained in the packet
- **Length**: The total length of the packet
- **Info**: Some infomation about the data in the packet (the payload) as interpreted by Wireshark

Not all the data packets are the same color. Coloring rules are used to provide high-level visual cues to help you quickly classify the different types of data. Since network packet capture files can contain large amounts of data, you can use coloring rules to quickly identify the data that is relevant to you. The example packet lists a group of light blue packets that all contain DNS traffic, followed by green packets that contain a mixture of TCP and HTTP protocol traffic.

ICMP is the protocol type listed for the first (and all) packets that contain 'Echo (ping) request' in the info column.

### Applying a basic Wireshark filter and inspecting a packet
When the filter `ip.addr == 142.250.1.139` is entered for traffic associated with a specific IP address, the list of packets displayed is now significantly reduced and contains only packets where either the source or the destination IP address matches the address you entered. Now only two packet colors are used: **light pink** for `ICMP` protocol packets and **light green** for `TCP` (and `HTTP`, which is a subset of `TCP`) packets.

When you double click a packet, this opens a packet details pane window. The details pane is also located at the bottom portion of the main Wireshark window.

The upper section of this window contains subtrees where Wireshark will provide you with an analysis of the various parts of the network packet. The lower section of the window contains the raw packet data displayed in hexadecimal and ASCII text. There is also placeholder text for fields where the character data does not apply, as indicated by the dot (“.”).

Based on the image above:
- The first subtree, **Frame**, provides you with details about the overall network packet, or frame, including the frame length and the arrival time of the packet. At this level, you’re viewing information about the entire packet of data.
- The second subtree, **Ethernet II**, contains details about the packet at the Ethernet level, including the source and destination MAC addresses and the type of internal protocol that the Ethernet packet contains.
- The third subtree label reflects the protocol. The **Internet Protocol Version 4** subtree provides packet data about the Internet Protocol (IP) data contained in the Ethernet packet. It contains information such as the source and destination IP addresses and the Internal Protocol (for example, TCP or UDP), which is carried inside the IP packet. 
The source and destination IP addresses shown here match the source and destination IP addresses in the summary display for this packet in the main Wireshark window.
- The **Transmission Control Protocol** subtree provides detailed information about the TCP packet, including the source and destination TCP ports, the TCP sequence numbers, and the TCP flags.
The source port and destination port listed here match the source and destination ports in the info column of the summary display for this packet in the list of all of the packets in the main Wireshark window.

As shown in the image below, the **Transmission Control Protocol** subtree provides a detailed view of the TCP flags set in this packet.

Port 80 is the TCP destination port for this packet. It contains the initial web request to an HTTP website that will typically be listening on TCP port 80.

### Using filters to select packets
The filter `ip.src == 142.250.1.139` selects traffic for a specific source IP address only.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea90fab6-e605-42b4-87ae-05a460e4a8a9)

A filtered list is returned with fewer entries than before. It contains only packets that came from **142.250.1.139**.

The filter `ip.dst == 142.250.1.139` selects for a specific destination IP address only.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db60033d-eab5-4c57-ad02-c354d89bd7b8)

A filtered list is returned that contains only packets that were sent to **142.250.1.139**.

The filter `eth.addr == 42:01:ac:15:e0:02` selects traffic to or from a specific Ethernet MAC address.

As shown in the image below, when the Ethernet II subtree in the first packet in the filtered list is selected, the MAC address you specified in the filter is listed as either the source or destination address in the expanded Ethernet II subtree.

The **Protocol** field in the **Internet Protocol Version 4** subtree indicates which IP internal protocol is contained in the packet. In the packet aabove, TCP is the internal protocol contained in the first packet from MAC address 42:01:ac:15:e0:02.

### Using filters to explore DNS packets
As shown in the image below, the `udp.port == 53` filter selects UDP port **53** traffic. DNS traffic uses UDP port **53**, so this will list traffic related to DNS queries and responses only.

In the first packet in the filtered list, when the **Domain Name System (query)** subtree is expanded, the name of the website that was queried is **opensource.google.com**. <br>
In the fourth packet in the filtered list, under the expanded **Domain Name System (query)** subtree, under **Answers**, the data includes the name that was queried (**opensource.google.com**) and the addresses that are associated with that name.
The IP address 142.250.1.139 is displayed in the expanded Answers section for the DNS query for **opensource.google.com**.

### Using filters to explore TCP packets
The `tcp.port == 80` filter selects TCP port **80** traffic. TCP port **80** is the default port that is associated with web traffic

As shown above, quite a few packets were created when the user accessed the web page **http://opensource.google.com**.

When the first packet (the **Destination** IP address of this packet is **169.254.169.254**) in the filtered list is selected:

1. The Time to Live value is 64. This property is contained in the Internet Protocol Version 4 subtree, which is the third subtree listed in the detailed packet inspection window.

2. The Frame Length is 54 bytes. This property is contained in the Frame subtree, which is the first subtree listed in the detailed packet inspection window.

3. The Header Length is 20 bytes and the Destination Address is 169.254.169.254. This property is defined in the Internet Protocol Version 4 subtree, which is the third subtree listed in the detailed packet inspection window.

The filter `tcp contains "curl"` selects TCP packet data that contains specific text data. This filters to packets containing web requests made with the `curl` command in this sample packet capture file.
