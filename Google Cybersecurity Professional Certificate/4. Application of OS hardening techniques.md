# Scenario
You are a cybersecurity analyst for yummyrecipesforme.com, a website that sells recipes and cookbooks. A former employee has decided to lure users to a fake website with malware. 

The former employee/ hacker executed a brute force attack to gain access to the web host. They repeatedly entered several known default passwords for the administrative account until they correctly guessed the right one. After they obtained the login credentials, they were able to access the admin panel and change the website’s source code. They embedded a javascript function in the source code that prompted visitors to download and run a file upon visiting the website. After embedding the malware, the hacker changed the password to the administrative account. When customers download the file, they are redirected to a fake version of the website that contains the malware. 

Several hours after the attack, multiple customers emailed yummyrecipesforme’s helpdesk. They complained that the company’s website had prompted them to download a file to access free recipes. The customers claimed that, after running the file, the address of the website changed and their personal computers began running more slowly. 

In response to this incident, the website owner tries to log in to the admin panel but is unable to, so they reach out to the website hosting provider. You and other cybersecurity analysts are tasked with investigating this security event.

To address the incident, you create a sandbox environment to observe the suspicious website behavior. You run the network protocol analyzer tcpdump, then type in the URL for the website, yummyrecipesforme.com. As soon as the website loads, you are prompted to download an executable file to update your browser. You accept the download and allow the file to run. You then observe that your browser redirects you to a different URL, greatrecipesforme.com, which contains the malware.

The logs show the following process:

1. The browser initiates a DNS request: It requests the IP address of the yummyrecipesforme.com URL from the DNS server.

2. The DNS replies with the correct IP address. 

3. The browser initiates an HTTP request: It requests the yummyrecipesforme.com webpage using the IP address sent by the DNS server.

4. The browser initiates the download of the malware.

5. The browser initiates a DNS request for greatrecipesforme.com.

6. The DNS server responds with the IP address for greatrecipesforme.com.

7. The browser initiates an HTTP request to the IP address for greatrecipesforme.com.

A senior analyst confirms that the website was compromised. The analyst checks the source code for the website. They notice that javascript code had been added to prompt website visitors to download an executable file. Analysis of the downloaded file found a script that redirects the visitors’ browsers from yummyrecipesforme.com to greatrecipesforme.com. 

The cybersecurity team reports that the web server was impacted by a brute force attack. The disgruntled hacker was able to guess the password easily because the admin password was still set to the default password. Additionally, there were no controls in place to prevent a brute force attack. 

## Security incident report
### Section 1: Identify the network protocol involved in the incident
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) was involved in the incident. This occurs at the application layer.

### Section 2: Document the incident
Multiple tickets were sent by customers via the yummyrecipesforme website’s helpdesk complaining that once they accessed the website, they were prompted to download a file to access free recipes. After running the file, the website address changed and their computers slowed down.

The website owner was unable to login to the admin portal resulting in them reaching out to the website host provider. The cybersecurity analyst created a sandbox environment to troubleshoot the issue and observe the behaviour of the suspicious website. The network protocol analyzer, tcpdump, was run to capture and analyze the data traffic. Once the website loaded, they were also prompted to download an executable file to update their browser. After accepting the download and allowing the file to run, the browser was redirected to a different URL, greatrecipesforme.com, which contained the malware.

The tcpdump logs show that at 2:18PM, a DNS request is sent to the DNS server for the website URL, yummyrecipesforme.com. The server replied with the IP address of the URL, 203.0.113.22. A connection request is then sent and acknowledged over the HTTP protocol and communication continued for about 2 minutes. At 2:20PM, another request is sent to the DNS server. The DNS server routes the traffic to a new IP address, 192.0.2.172 and URL, greatrecipesforme.com.http. The traffic changes to the new spoofed website. The port number also changes to .56378.

The senior analyst checked the website’s source code and notices a javascript code that was added by the malicious attacker that prompted the download of an executable file once the website is accessed. The downloaded file had a script that redirects visitors from yummyrecipesforme.com to greatrecipesforme.com.

The cybersecurity team also reported that the web server suffered a brute force attack whereby the hacker got access to the admin account by using the default password and changing it, locking out the website owner.

### Section 3: Recommend one remediation for brute force attacks
- Introduction of password policies: The default password should be immediately changed after the first login, and passwords should be updated regularly. A limit on the number of login attempts should also be introduced. If login attempts fail repeatedly, an alert should be sent, and the account should be put on hold or suspended.
- Introduction of multi-factor authentication: User verification during login should be implemented, either through a one-time password (OTP) or biometrics.
